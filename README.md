Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It serves as a decision-support tool for HR departments to identify employees at risk of leaving and take 
proactive retention measures.

Objectives

* Analyze employee data to predict attrition risk.
* Identify key factors influencing employee turnover.
* Provide actionable insights for HR management.
* Support talent retention and workforce planning.

Key Features

* Attrition risk prediction using machine learning models.
* Data preprocessing and feature encoding for accurate predictions.
* Interactive user input for real-time prediction outcomes.
* Focus on workload, performance, and demographic factors.

Technology Stack

* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
* CSV-based dataset (HR employee data)

Dataset Description

* Sourced from open HR datasets.
* Contains demographic details, job factors, performance metrics, and attrition status.
* Includes both numerical and categorical features.
* Data preprocessing involves cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.

Expected Outcomes

* Identification of high-risk employees.
* Insights into factors contributing to attrition.
* Enhanced HR decision-making with data-driven insights.
* Potential for real-time alerts and dashboards in future iterations.

Future Enhancements

* Integration of sentiment analysis from employee feedbacks.
